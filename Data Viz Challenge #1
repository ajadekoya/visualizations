Viz Challenge #1
  
As an ex-teacher I wanted to make the first viz challenge about the education sector. As a teacher you are regularly analysing student data to inform your planning and systems of support, so this task replicates that. What determines student's success? Who may need more support to achieve higher grades? Present your findings to the school as a visualisation to provide insight for their future planning.
